# Sahel-Real-time-Traffic-Flow-Optimization-for-Riyadh
This project addresses traffic congestion in Riyadh by developing a real-time vehicle detection, tracking, and speed limit adjustment system using YOLOv9. The system provides accurate, real-time insights into vehicular movement and dynamically adjusts speed limits based on traffic flow, enhancing urban traffic management. The methodology involves collecting and annotating a comprehensive dataset, training a custom YOLOv9 model, and implementing vehicle tracking and speed estimation algorithms. Findings demonstrate significant improvements in vehicle detection accuracy and real-time traffic flow optimization, contributing to Saudi Vision 2030 by promoting smart city initiatives and sustainable urban developmen
